# temperature_controller

Build date: (20 June, 2021)

This project was an individual task required from me in Embedded Systems class.

1- Project description:

    This Embedded System is designed to provide a temperature controlled 
    functionality. The system provides the ability to reach a targeted temperature 
    requested by a user interface. The system also provides information for the 
    user about: (the system state - the current temperature - the selected set 
    temperature). 
 
2- Tools:

    (Atmega32 Microcontroller - Character LCD - TC72 SPI to temperature 
    convertor - 4X3 Keypad - PWM to voltage convertor module - Calibration 
    resistor).
